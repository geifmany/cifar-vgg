# cifar-vgg
This is a Keras model based on VGG16 architecture for CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. it can be used either with pretrained weights file or trained from scratch.

This package contains 2 classes one for each datasets, the architecture is based on the VGG-16 [1] with adaptation to CIFAR datasets based on [2]. By running the py files you can get a sample of a trining and estimation of validation error.

The CIFAR-10 reaches a validation accuracy of 93.56%
CIFAR-100 reaches validation accuracy of 70.48%.
On instantiation the model can either be trained or loaded from previous saved weight file.
